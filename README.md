# âš½ AI Football Tracker: Real-Time Match Insights


Welcome to **AI Football Tracker**! This project revolutionizes how football is analyzed, bringing the game to life through advanced computer vision techniques. Our AI system detects players, referees, goalkeepers, and the ball, offering real-time visualizations and insights into match dynamics. Whether you're a football fan, data enthusiast, or AI researcher, this project will ignite your passion for the sport and technology!

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- **Player and Referee Detection**:  Track all players, referees, and the ball in real time using the YOLOv8n model paired with BoTSORT for precise identification.

- **Goalkeeper Recognition**:  Identify goalkeepers distinctively for specialized game analysis.

- **Teams Differentiation**: Separate the two teams on the field using PCA and KMeans clustering, simplifying performance analysis.

- **Live Visualizations:**: Generate dynamic, real-time visual representations of game states, helping to easily understand the flow and progress of the match.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Enhancements

This project is inspired by a YouTube tutorial, but we've made several improvements:

- Faster Detection: Switched to YOLOv8n from YOLOv8x for improved speed without losing accuracy.
- Enhanced Keypoint Detection: Leveraged YOLOv8n Pose for more efficient pose recognition.
- Optimized Player Clustering: Refined player clustering using PCA and KMeans without the need for ReID.
- Improved Visualizations: Integrated more effective visualization techniques from the Supervision repository.

Tracking Model: BoTSORT is used for accurate multi-object tracking.
